# Email Spam Detection using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Email spam detection is a classification task that involves identifying emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). This project uses RNN-based models, such as LSTM and GRU, to achieve high accuracy in detecting spam emails.

## **Features**
- Utilizes modern machine learning techniques (RNN, LSTM, GRU).
- Compares performance with traditional methods like KNN and Naive Bayes.
- Achieves high accuracy in filtering spam emails.

## **System Requirements**
- **Operating System**: Linux or Windows
- **RAM**: Minimum 4 GB
- **Storage**: Minimum 1 TB
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or later
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## **Installation Instructions**
1. Install Python (inbuilt in Linux; use Anaconda for Windows).
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib opencv-python pandas keras
